1. **Data**, storing the datasets used for the project
2. **Main**, storing the scripts for model simulation and fitting
3. **Parameter**, storing the scripts for parameter estimation
4. **Sensitivity**, storing the scripts used in parameter sensitivity analysis for 
  - relative infectiousness of subclinical infections
  - measure that recommends the cancellation of public events

### :bulb:Coding

The measures in the scripts were coded as follows:
1. **c1.1**, corresponding to the measure that recommended the school closure

3. **c4.4**, corresponding to the measure that required the restriction of gatherings to 10 people or fewer
4. **c4.3**, corresponding to the measure that required the restriction of gatherings to 100 people or fewer
